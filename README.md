What is Git?)
Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

# It is used for:
**********************************************************************************************************************
Tracking code changes
Tracking who made changes
Coding collaboration
## What does Git do?
Manage projects with Repositories
Clone a project to work on a local copy
Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
Push local updates to the main project
Working with Git
Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
You select the modified files you want to Stage
The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
You can revert back to any previous commit.
Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

## Why Git?
Over 70% of developers use Git!
Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
Developers can see the full history of the project.
Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
# What is GitHub?
*****************************************************************************************************************

## Git is not the same as GitHub.
### GitHub makes tools that use Git.
### GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
### In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
********************************************************************************************************

# GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Showcase or share your work.
Track and manage changes to your code over time.
Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.
Collaborative working, one of GitHub’s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built.

## How do Git and GitHub work together?
When you upload files to GitHub, you'll store them in a "Git repository." This means that when you make changes (or "commits") to your files in GitHub, Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.

There are plenty of Git-related actions that you can complete on GitHub directly in your browser, such as creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.

However, most people work on their files locally (on their own computer), then continually sync these local changes—and all the related Git data—with the central "remote" repository on GitHub. There are plenty of tools that you can use to do this, such as GitHub Desktop.

Once you start to collaborate with others and all need to work on the same repository at the same time, you’ll continually:

#### Pull all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on GitHub.
#### Push back your own changes to the same remote repository on GitHub.
#### Git figures out how to intelligently merge this flow of changes, and GitHub helps you manage the flow through features such as "pull requests."
